# Tier 2 - Login, Hashing
As a User, I want to be able to log in to my API
As a User, I want any passwords saved to be hashed and salted before saved to the database (note: If you use OAuth, you might not even store passwords at all!)

# Tier 3 - Register
As a potential User, I want to be able to sign up for the API
As a signed-up User, I want to be granted authorization to access the API

# Tier 4 - Authorization

As a User, I want my API protected from unauthorized Users
As an unauthorized User, I want a helpful message telling me I do not have access to the API
(optional, but recommended): As a user, I want to receive a helpful error message anytime there is a problem with the request (i.e. error handling middleware)
As a User, I expect not to be able to create new entities without first logging in / authenticating in some way (token/session)
As a User, I want my data to only be accessible by myself
As a User, I want my data to only be editable/deletable by myself
